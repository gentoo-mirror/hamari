Personal Gentoo Overlay of `hamari`
===================================

This Gentoo Portage Overlays contains a selection of packages meeting my
personal interests.


Amateur Radio :radio:
---------------------

### ARDOP

The Amateur Radio Digital Open Protocol is an ARQ data transmission protocol
used for the Winlink communication system. This ebuild provides different ARDOP
software modems. Only `ardopc` is supported by Winlink.

### CHIRP

CHIRP is a tool to program memory channels and configure settings of amateur
radio devices. CHIRP was dropped from the Gentoo repository due to lacking
Python 3 support. This repo represents the merge of the upstream Python 2
branch as of 2021-08-12 into the upstreams Python 3 branch combined with
patches from [atpage](https://github.com/atpage/chirp). In contains some
further patches by myself. THIS SOFRWARE COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NOT WARRANTY.

Acknowledgements: The ebuild is based on the work of the Pentoo project.
  Patches of [atpage](https://github.com/atpage/chirp) are applied.

### CQRLOG

A logging program.

### GPS SDR SIM

Generates GPS baseband signals for various SDR transceivers.

### Fldigi Suite

The Fldigi suite by Dave Freese, W1HKJ is a well known set of handy amateur
radio utilities. Some of these programs are included in the gentoo standard
repository. This repo provides the remaining utilities. The ebuilds from this
repo provide the `xmlrpc` USE flag. But it seems support for this library is
broken, since some tools require a more recent version than publicly available.

### Pat

Pat is a Winlink 2000 protocol client.

### SDRangel

A very powerful signal analyzer and synthesizer supporting a wide range of
hardware devices.

 * Pentoo

### Xnecview

Xnecview is a software for visualizing the input and output files of the NEC
antenna simulation software.


Astronomy :telescope:
---------------------

### Astropy

A feature rich astronomical package for Python.

### INDI

The repo contains a recent version of INDI including all 3rd-party drivers.

Acknowledgement: These ebuilds are based on the work of Ctibor Brančík whose
repo disappeared unfortunately.

### SiriL

SiriL is an astronomical image processing software. This repo also contains
needed dependencies which are not available from the standard repo as well as
some additional utilities:

 * pysiril: A python library for scripting SiriL
 * sirilic: Preparing acquisition files for processing with the SiriL software

Acknowledgement: These ebuild are based on the work of
 * Ctibor Brančík
 * [SFtech](https://github.com/SFTtech/gentoo-overlay)

### Skyfield
