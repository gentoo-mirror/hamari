Personal Gentoo Overlay of `hamari`
===================================

This Gentoo Portage Overlays contains a selection of packages meeting my
personal interests.


Amateur Radio :radio:
---------------------

### QSSTV

Although QSSTV is contained in the standard repo it mandatorily requires
pulseaudio. This package allows to substitute pulseaudio with apulse.


Astronomy :telescope:
---------------------

### INDI

The repo contains a recent version of INDI including all 3rd-party drivers.
These ebuilds are based on the work of Ctibor Brančík whose repo disappeared
unfortunately.

### Siril

Siril is an astronomical image processing software. This repo also contains
needed dependencies which are not available from the standard repo.


Computer Forensics, Reverse engineering :mag:
---------------------------------------------

### iaito

It's a graphical frontend for radare2, which is available in the main gentoo
portage tree.
